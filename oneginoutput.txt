 your turn long after they are gone,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or being hated don't give way to hating,
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
Or walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,
If you can think-and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'
And-which is more-you'll be a Man, my son!
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can dream-and not make dreams your master;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
And never breathe a word about your loss;
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If you can keep your head when all about you
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

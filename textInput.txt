1
Life, believe, is not a dream
So dark as sages say;
Oft a little morning rain
Foretells a pleasant day.
2
Sometimes there are clouds of gloom,
But these are transient all;
If the shower will make the roses bloom,
Oh, why lament its fall?
3
Rapidly, merrily,
Life’s sunny hours flit by,
Gratefully, cheerily,
Enjoy them as they fly!
4
What though Death at times steps in
And calls our best away?
What though sorrow seems to win,
O’er hope, a heavy sway?
5
Yet Hope again elastic springs,
Unconquered, though she fell;
Still buoyant are her golden wings,
Still strong to bear us well.
6
Manfully, fearlessly,
The day of trial bear,
For gloriously, victoriously,
Can courage quell despair!
